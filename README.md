- Analyzed the impacted NFRs and stakeholders, and implementations of a proposed feature of
Apollo through the SAMM analysis method.
- Proposed and realized the enhancement for the specific subsystem while minimized the
risks to NFRs, strengthening the overall efficiency.
- Applied SciTools Understand for mapping the code to build a concrete architecture of
Apollo system then performed the Reflexion Analysis on it.
